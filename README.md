# Chicken Feeder Project 🐔

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a chicken feeder that could be controlled remotely via a Discord bot. My friend has a camera in his chicken coop, and I thought it would be a fun way for my friends and me to interact with the chickens.

I decided to use a Raspberry Pi 🥧 for this project because I had an extra onelyingg around.

I decided to use MQTT for the messaging between the Discord bot and the feeder. This allowed for easy command transmission because the feeder wouldn't be on my local network. This also allowed me to extend control to another Raspberry Pi 🥧 in my home setup that runs my Discord bot.

## Features
- **Discord Bot Integration 🤖:** Interact with the feeder remotely through Discord commands.

- **Servo Motor Control 🛠️:** Control the feeder mechanism using servo motors.

- **Custom Enclosure Design 🏠:** I Designed the enclosure and dispensing mechanism using Blender 🖥️ and 3d printed all the parts
