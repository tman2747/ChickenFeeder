# Chicken Feeder Project

## Overview

The goal of this project was to create a chicken feeder that could be controlled remotely via a Discord bot. My friend has a camera in his chicken coop and I thought it would be a fun way my friends and I to interact with the chickens. 

I decided to to use a rasberry pi for this project because I had a extra one laying around.

I decided to use MQTT for the messaging between the Discord bot and the feeder. This allowed for easy command transmission but also allowed me to extend control to another Raspberry Pi in my home setup.
